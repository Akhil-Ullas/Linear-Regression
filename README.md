# Linear-Regression

---


Linear Regression is one of the most fundamental techniques in machine learning, yet it remains one of the most misunderstood. At its core, it models the relationship between one or more input variables and a continuous output by fitting the “best-possible” line through the data.

Despite how simple it looks, Linear Regression forces you to understand the fundamentals that every advanced model still relies on:

* **How variables influence each other**
* **How to prepare clean, usable data**
* **How assumptions affect results**
* **How to evaluate a model beyond accuracy metrics**
* **How to interpret what the model is actually learning**

From predicting salaries to estimating house prices, forecasting trends, or understanding feature importance, Linear Regression provides a transparent and mathematically grounded framework for deriving insights.

It’s not “basic” — it’s foundational.
Mastering it makes every next algorithm easier to understand, debug, and apply effectively.
